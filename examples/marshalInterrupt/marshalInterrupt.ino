/**
 * This example shows how to marshal an interrupt via task manager. Task manager can register an interrupt on any
 * supported pin, including handling interrupts from external IO devices such as PCF8574 and MCP23017. It does so
 * by registering a raw interrupt handler on your behalf, and then creating a high priority interrupt task when it
 * is triggered.
 *
 * NOTE: This means that there is slight latency on your code being triggered, and it should not be used for anything
 * that is even remotely time critical. For time critical items, do the work that must be done immediately in a direct
 * ISR, then trigger task manager using an event. Never add a task directly in a raw ISR.
 *
 * There is a getting started guide including video available:
 * https://www.thecoderscorner.com/products/arduino-libraries/taskmanager-io/

// apart from delay here.

// Here we set the interrupt task handler, and add the interrupt, the syntax is very similar to attachInterrupt.

// This is the regular loop method for a taskManager sketch, just repeatedly calls runLoop. If you want to use
// this library in a low power situation, then you can use a low power library for your board, see the comments
// within loop. If you use a low power delay function, it must be able to come out of sleep for interrupts on the
// pins that you have interrupts, otherwise, taskManager will not work.
//

    taskManager.runLoop();
