/*
TaskManagement Example for BasicIoAbstraction library

TaskManager is designed to replace the standard delay() then do something pattern in Arduino code.
When using this library, we express waits differently, more in line with in 10 seconds turn
on the led. To do this we use a scheduler that controls when tasks are done. For each task
that we schedule, we provide a function that will be called upon that schedule. This example
shows all the uses of the scheduler, for a simpler example, see the timedBlink example.

To test the interrupt support, wire a switch to pin 2 with pull up/down. Each change of state
will cause an interrupt.
