 * TaskManager is a lightweight cooperative co-routine implementation for Arduino, it works by scheduling tasks to be
 * done either immediately, or at a future point in time. It is quite efficient at scheduling tasks as internally tasks
 * are arranged in time order in a linked list. Tasks can be provided as either a function to be called, or a class
 * that implements the Executable interface. Tasks can be scheduled to run either ASAP, once, or repeated.
 *
 * Events can be added based on extensions of the BaseEvent class, these can be triggered outside of task manager and
 * they can then "wake up" task manager, events can also be polled. In addition interrupts can be marshalled through
 * task manager, any interrupt managed by task manager will be marshalled into a task. IE outside of an ISR.
 *
 * There is a globally defined variable called `taskManager` and you should attach this to your main loop. You can
 * create other task managers on different threads if required. For most use cases, the class is thread safe.
